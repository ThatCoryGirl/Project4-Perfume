# **Methodology**

- Dataset pulled from [Fragrantica.com](https://www.fragrantica.com/)

- Datascraping was already done on this github called [Perfume_Designer_App](https://github.com/sir-omoreno/perfume_designer_app)

  - Datascraping at Fragrantica could have taken up the entire timeframe for this project due to inconsistencies of website/forum
